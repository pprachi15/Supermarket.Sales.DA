# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project aims to analyze supermarket sales data and predict sales using machine learning techniques.

## Introduction

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about various products and their sales in different supermarkets. The goal is to explore the data, handle missing values, preprocess features, and build a machine learning model to predict sales.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Run the Python script:

```
python supermarket_sales_analysis.py
```

The script will perform data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and sales prediction.
